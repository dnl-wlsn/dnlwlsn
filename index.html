												<h4>SEGA</h4>
												<p>My first testing role was at SEGA, straight after graduating. I studied Digital Music & Computer Games Design at University and, like most teenagers, loved playing games... which definitely helped in getting a job here.</p>
											</div>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>

												<h4>SQS</h4>
												<p>After meeting a real(!) software tester, I applied for a role at Software Quality Systems and was sent to South Africa for three weeks, had a crash course in testing, and passed my ISTQB Foundation.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>HRG, GC, TF</h4>
												<p>Whilst at the consultancy, I worked for the Home Retail Group (retail), Gala Coral (gaming / gambling), and Think Finance (...finance, obviously). I was then poached by Think Finance and started work there permanently.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Think Finance</h4>
												<p>Absolutely loved it here. We were a small team doing some big work, was learning loads, and it felt like family. I was here for two years before venturing in to contracting, thinking the grass could be greener </p>
											</div>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Oakam</h4>
												<p>Oakam was my first contracting role and a real lesson in life. There's no safety net in contracting, no real perks... just lots of sleepless nights and paperwork. I was here for six months before going heading to back to Think Finance. </p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Elevate</h4>
												<p>Think Finance had a name change whilst I was gone, but the startup feel and family vibe was still there. I was contracting here for a further 1.5 years until heading off to my final contracting role.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Cabot</h4>
												<p>I didn't really know it at the time, but Cabot would be my final contract role. I found that contractors were treated differently and I was more interested in permanency.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Connells</h4>
												<p>It was harder going back to permanent work because companies assumed you'd dump them as soon as another contract came along. Unfortunately, Connells was just too slow-paced and I didn't really enjoy it.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>NewDay</h4>
												<p>I was referred to NewDay and took a step in to credit risk testing. It was fun here - the offices were awesome and the people were great. However, credit risk testing wasn't really for me... </p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Simply Business</h4>
												<p>I was referred to Simply Business and found a new family. I really love it here, but there's no room for progression... which is why I'm open to new roles and probably why you're reading this! </p>
